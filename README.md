### Self reflection
 
 
When I decided to get my computer science degree back in 2017, I knew it would be an enriching journey, to say the least. The program as a whole has taught me everything that I need to be successful in this field. This capstone has been very interesting to get through Unscathed and in one piece. I feel my knowledge in python database management has grown immensely throughout my program of study. It's been a combination of the classes that catered to those particular skills and practicing and developing things on my own to hone in the product that I present, which is myself. Throughout the milestones for my computer science Capstone, I think of these particular choices in mind for a test to show me weaknesses and things that I can improve daily, whether personally or personally. Professionally. The artifacts I chose were to enhance a 3-D triangle with scenic movement using a camera and lighting implement mentation. The next artifact displays my ability to use object-oriented programming through the passenger classroom from the cruise ship application. The last and final artifact shows my ability to be able to use the database application mongo DB along with python to create an animal shelter application that intakes a variety of animals based upon the animal’s age animals birthdate the gender of the animal as well as different system features that help the in user manage the animals that come into the shelter for this application.

### [Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering](https://github.com/KennethPosley/CS499CompSciCapstoneKP/tree/main/CS-499%20Enhancement%20One)


**Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?**

The artifact that I’ve chosen for this enhancement is the pet class originally written in the java language from my IT-145 course which took place about a year ago. The pet class was created for a pet check-in project which end with an application that would a set of standard information about the animal and which kennel it would stay in.

**Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your portfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?**

I selected this artifact and have chosen to include it in my ePortfolio because, form what I remember from this project it included many elements s of the software engineering /design process which included writing pseudocode to map out the logic and code flow, creating a flowchart for design logic, and finally taking each of these integral precursors and using them to create the code. I chose to enhance the entire class because there wasn’t one portion of the file that I would honestly justify an enhancement. I chose to improve this artifact by rewriting the original Java code in the Python language. I chose to make this enhancement because I think it showcases my ability and knowledge of the Python language.
 
**Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates on your outcome- coverage plans?**

Yes, I think that I have met the objectives for this enhancement however rewriting the original java code into python was not part of my original enhance but to be honest there was much depth to the enhancement plan. I would like to update my outcome-coverage plan with my new enhancement plan of rewriting the pet check-in class code form it origin language of java to python as it seemed to increase the speed of compilation by a few seconds.

**Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?**

When reflecting on my enhancement of the pet check-in artifact for the IT-145 course, I’ve learned that all programming versatile in their right, but python is a very clean and efficient language to use in pretty much any area of application.  The only challenges I faced during this enhancement converting some syntax such as the definitions and calling the attributes, so I mainLY referred to documentation as well a lot of trial and error.


### [Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/KennethPosley/KennethPosley.github.io/blob/main/PassengerEnhanced.java)


**Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created**

The other factor I have chosen is from my IT 149 class foundations of application development. The artifact itself is a part of the entire application it is the passenger class for the application I would say this artifact was created maybe a year and a half ago.

**Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in algorithms and data structure? How was the artifact improved?** 

I feel deserve this artifact should be included in my E-portfolio because I think that it alliance greatly busy milestones that are intended for which are algorithms and data structure. I selected this artifact because I saw that there could be a little more to the code by way of slide enhancements commenting just overall cleaning coat up a bit. The specific pony components that showcase my skills in algorithms and data structures for this artifact are my understanding of object-oriented programming as well as being able to lay out my statements and methods and I a very logical way that not only improves program runtime as well as improving the program’s readability for future enhancements or being able to have the code validated by a tester.

**Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?**

I do feel as if I’m with the course objectives as well as my plan enhancements before for this particular milestone however reading my instructor’s feedback I did understand that the code was a bit commented there were some missing components as well however because of this is one piece to the overall puzzle which is of the entire Cruise application I feel as if I’ve cut of taken more of a methodical approach and enhanced all of the classes for the program itself instead of one of the main classes out with passenger scheduling and room assignment. Which is of the entire Cruise application I feel as if I’ve cut or taken more of a methodical approach and enhanced all of the classes for the program itself instead of one of the main classes out with Pastor scheduling and assignment room assignment.

**Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?**

Throughout the process of enhancing effect cleaned up to go to bed as well as home commented in some places on more information necessary as well as removed comments that were unnecessary to the programmer as well as for example when a tester that would be reviewing the code for any bugs and trying to follow the logic of the program itself. What I learned creating this project when I was in the class is that object-oriented programming is a very important skill that is going to serve me immensely professional as well as while improving it I got to kind of relearn some of the things that were taught in the class some of the little nuances about the Java programming language. One of the challenges that I faced with this enhancement was trying to figure out and justify more of an enhancement to the already solid cold base I feel as if had and I don’t think I spent as much time with this one as I should but I think it was definitely a great learning experience to keep with me next time I’m in a class like this and possibly plan out the enhancement or fix that I’m going to implement into already existing code.



### [Enhancement Three: Databases](https://github.com/KennethPosley/KennethPosley.github.io/blob/main/AnimalShelterEnhanced.py)


**Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?**

The artifact that I’ve chosen for this milestone is some Python code from my CS340 class.
In that class, we used CRUD to create an animal shelter intake application that would prompt the app used for the animal’s various attributes.

**Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?**

I would like to include this artifact in my portfolio because it aligns with the overall expectations of the current milestones this week. In addition, I want to enhance this artifact by rewriting the code and making it easy the read because looking back at the original code, it was all over the place. Python and MongoDB were used for this artifact, and refamiliarizing myself with the database concepts should be interesting. Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates on your outcome-coverage plans?
Yes, I feel as if I met the course objectives that I planned, and no, I do not have any updates on my outcome coverage plans.

**Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn?**

The challenges I faced were how much time it took to rewrite my AnimalShelter.py code and have successfully compiled it. I also realize that since MongoDB is a service, it is not available for
free, making obtaining access difficult as I do not have access to the Linux virtual machine used with the class.
