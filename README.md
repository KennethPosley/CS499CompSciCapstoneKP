### Professional Self-Assessment
 
 When I decided to get my computer science degree in 2017, I knew it would be an enriching journey. I soon discovered that completing my coursework throughout the program and developing the ePortfolio helped showcase my strengths and shape my goals and values. Furthermore, it has prepared me to enter or become more employable in computer science. Given my current status as a student, I will share my experience with how the curriculum, the ePortfolio assignment, and extracurricular activities have aided my professional development. In my college experience, I have found that developing a solid professional identity has helped me become more capable and well-rounded. The process was exciting and extremely rewarding as I learned more about me and developed a deeper understanding of the roles I fulfill within the computer science community. Furthermore, I discovered new ways of thinking about my studies and became more aware of my potential to impact society around me positively.


 My major in Computer Science has enabled me to explore various aspects of computer science, including programming, algorithms, cybersecurity, data analysis, and more. Through multiple courses in the program, I have learned valuable skills such as problem-solving, technical writing, graphic design, programming, and project management, which have helped me become a better programmer and contributed to my overall growth as a computer scientist and a professional. These skills were developed through classes that taught me how to analyze and solve complex programming problems using algorithms and data structures to build programs. In addition to learning about algorithms and data structures, I have completed computer architecture and operating systems courses, which gave me a strong foundation in the field.

 The Software Design and Engineering artifact shows my ability to design functional and efficient software programs based on predefined requirements and specifications. The source code is created using Python programming language, which was recreated from Java and tested to ensure it works as expected. 

 The Data structures and Algorithms artifact showcase my knowledge of the fundamental principles and methodologies of programming languages such as C++ and Python by demonstrating my ability to create various data structures and perform basic operations in an algorithm. The source code developed in this artifact is written in C++, the most commonly used programming language in research and industry. But for the enhancement, I rewrote the c++ code in Python for future usability. 

The Database artifact was created from a .csv file and created with SQL. I then took the information from that file and created an HTML interface to display that information in a browser. JavaScript was used to interface my from-end code with the back-end MongoDB database. This gave me experience creating database-backed web applications from scratch, which will come in very handy in the future as I develop my career.

### [Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering](https://github.com/KennethPosley/CS499CompSciCapstoneKP/tree/main/CS-499%20Enhancement%20One)


**Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?**

The artifact that I’ve chosen for this enhancement is the pet class originally written in the java language from my IT-145 course which took place about a year ago. The pet class was created for a pet check-in project which end with an application that would a set of standard information about the animal and which kennel it would stay in.

**Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your portfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?**

I selected this artifact and have chosen to include it in my ePortfolio because, form what I remember from this project it included many elements s of the software engineering /design process which included writing pseudocode to map out the logic and code flow, creating a flowchart for design logic, and finally taking each of these integral precursors and using them to create the code. I chose to enhance the entire class because there wasn’t one portion of the file that I would honestly justify an enhancement. I chose to improve this artifact by rewriting the original Java code in the Python language. I chose to make this enhancement because I think it showcases my ability and knowledge of the Python language.
 
**Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates on your outcome- coverage plans?**

Yes, I think that I have met the objectives for this enhancement however rewriting the original java code into python was not part of my original enhance but to be honest there was much depth to the enhancement plan. I would like to update my outcome-coverage plan with my new enhancement plan of rewriting the pet check-in class code form it origin language of java to python as it seemed to increase the speed of compilation by a few seconds.

**Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?**

When reflecting on my enhancement of the pet check-in artifact for the IT-145 course, I’ve learned that all programming versatile in their right, but python is a very clean and efficient language to use in pretty much any area of application.  The only challenges I faced during this enhancement converting some syntax such as the definitions and calling the attributes, so I mainly referred to documentation as well a lot of trial and error.


### [Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/KennethPosley/CS499CompSciCapstoneKP/tree/main/CS-499%20Enhancement%20Two)


**Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created**

The Artifact that I’ve chosen to enhance is a Hash Table Algorithm from my Data Structures and Algorithms class CS-260, which took place a little more than two years ago. The Hash table is a data structure that stores information in an associative manner. This means that it is stored in an array, which gives each data value its unique index value, allowing for easy access.

**Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in algorithms and data structure? How was the artifact improved?** 

I selected this artifact and have chosen to include it in my ePortfolios because of this assignment’s alignment with the many elements that were introduced in Data Structures and Algorithms CS-260. These elements include but are not limited to advanced algorithmic design, evaluation of complex data structures, and development methodologies. Before I started development, I gave the hash table a good once over to refamiliarize myself with the code flow and researched different data structures and how they work. After, I began rewriting the hash table into the Python language. My skill is showcased with this data structure because, although originally written in C++, many code changes were riddled with errors when writing in Python.

**Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?**

Yes, I do think that I have met the course objectives specifically CS-449-03, and CS-499-04. Throughout this enhancement I’ve had to utilities development best practices such creating pseudocode for some portions of the enhancement to better understand the logic being used. Other techniques regarding testing are using a method in which I only debugged small portion of the code checking for syntax and design errors accordingly. I would like to update my coverage plan to and an element of testing and debugging as there was a very unfortunate number of errors to sift through to deliver a viable result.

**Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?**

When reflecting on my enhancement of the Hash table data structure artifact from my CS-260 course, I’ve learned and refamiliarized myself many of the data structure and algorithm foundational concept that were learn so long ago. Modifying this artifact has also taught me the importance of logic and design, there were many moments spent just trying the visualize and wrap my mind around the code structure and how it would transition from one language to another. But all in all, the challenges I face were with syntax and debugging, those were the two elements that caused the most difficulties



### [Enhancement Three: Databases](https://github.com/KennethPosley/CS499CompSciCapstoneKP/tree/main/CS-499%20Enhancement%20Three)


**Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?**

The artifact that I've chosen to enhance is a SQL database .csv file from my DAD 220 course two years ago. The portion of the database that I will be enhancing is the "employees" table. This table contains the names, salaries, security access level, and employment status of all the employees in the company. 

**Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?**

I've chosen to include this artifact in my ePortfolio because of think that it aligned greatly with the overall objective to meet the requirements for the final project. I selected the employee Human Resources portion of the SQL database because I thought it would be a challenge as well as a great way to learn new development concepts that I have never explored before. The specific component of the HR database artifact showcases my knowledge of SQL and database integration. I improved the artifact by creating a user simple user interface that takes the prompted values and stores them In the MongoDB cloud database which I integrated using HTML, JavaScript, Express, and Node. JS.

**Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?**

Yes, specifically CS-499-03, and CS-499-04. The reason being is because although the application is simply designed, I had to consider taking a very logic approach as to how achieve my goal of creating a front end to take the Human Resources information and link it to a MongoDB data that can queried. I also to a semi-testing route by setting up nodemon a tool within node. JS to run the database connection processes along error checking hard code into my index.js file.

**Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn?**

When it came to enhancing my artifact from DAD 220 course, I didn’t really understand the undertaking it would be to get everything about my enhancement working the way I wanted. I started this enhancement with a .csv file for the HR and Information Systems department for the lab. It only contained the names and which department the employee worked but I feel that was more than enough information to lay the groundwork, which entailed configuring my database via the shell, and the writing the database connection code in JavaScript which I am not well-versed in. Next, I wrote the code that would essentially talk to the HTML code outlining what input information to prompt the user for. I learned throughout this enhancement that falling back on the foundation concepts of design a crucial when starting any application project. The challenges I faced were mainly some logic errors dealing with the JavaScript code as well as database connection issues between the code and the application itself not submitting the input information my database.
